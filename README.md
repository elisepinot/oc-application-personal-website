# Personal Website - OpenClassRooms Application

I created this website as a prerequisite for applying to the Javascript React Developer path at OpenClassRooms. The task involved developing a project using HTML and CSS and providing an explanatory video for the code.

So this is the first website I ever created! ðŸ˜€
